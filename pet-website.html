    <p style="color: orange">Hello! I am Sam's dog Mafalda.<br>
      <img src="../img/i-love-my-dog-mafalda.jpeg" alt="picture of a dog that looks like Mafalda" width="250" />
      <br>I am 15 years old and still cute! I've been living around cats for years and I have some advice for living with our feline friends
    </p>
    <ol style="color: orange; background-color: green">
       <li><strong>Do not try to eat the cat.</strong> They may seem delicious, but I promise it won't end well.</li>
       <li><strong>Lick the cat at your own risk.</strong> Some of them like it, some of them tolerate it and some of them will scratch your eye out.</li>
       <li>Cats hate the following things:
         <ul>
           <li>Water</li>
           <li>Vacuums (we have this in common!)</li>
           <li>Being bitten</li>
         </ul>
    </ol>
    <p style="color: blue">And I am Aaron's cat Daisy!<br>

    <br>I have never lived with a dog and I am a bit skeptical about them.  Here are some of my primary concerns about dogs:
    </p>
    <ul style="color: blue; background-color: grey">
      <li>I hear they smell. Especially when they get that gross water stuff on them.</li>
      <li>They make a lot of noise, which would be distressing to my sensitive ears</li>
      <li>They seem so needy what with always demanding attention from the humans</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>How to coexist</h3>
    <img src="../img/coexist.jpeg" alt="a photo of a cat being sniffed by a dog" width="250"/>
    <p style="color: blue">I assume that the most important part of coexistence with the enemy would be having adequate space for personal time.  I like to enjoy sitting by myself on the couch and not being disturbed.  I think this would be a great time for the human to take the dog out somewhere I don't have to see or smell it!
    </p>
    <p style="color: orange">The best advice I can give to any dog is to leave the cat alone. They can't even sit on command! We know we are smarter and superior. Do not let them trick you!
    </p>
    <h3>Cuddling</h3>
    <img src="../img/cuddling.jpeg" alt="doggy and kitty cuddling" width="250"/>
    <p style="color: blue">I cannot express strongly enough that no-one should ever <em>try</em> to snuggle a cat.  When I am ready I will come and purr at you and walk onto the area I wish to sleep on.
    </p>
    <p style="color: orange">Us puppies love to cuddle. We <em>live</em>for cuddling. So if you're a cat, you can cuddle with us, but be careful. Some doggies like to play a little too much.

    <h3>Additional Resources</h3>
    <p style="color: blue">
      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dog-Training-Dummies-Jack-Volhard/dp/0470600292">
        Here</a>
        is a good resource for making sure that your dog isn't doing anything untoward in or around the house. I actually heard that dogs will bring back the same item repeatedly instead of depositing a simple gift of a bird or a mouse like one is supposed to.  However, since I am an indoor cat I don't have to worry about keeping the neighborhood free from dangerous pests.
